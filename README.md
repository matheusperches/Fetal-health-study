## [Fetal-Health-Study](https://github.com/matheusperches/Fetal-health-study)

#### A study on Fetal Health. 

#### Background
This prroject was part of my Software Architecture course and I followed along while creating this project and training the models. I decided to add this specific project due to my interest in the health department with Machine Learning algorithms.

This project includes a prediction model for fetal health based on user fed parameters.

#### Learnings
- MLFlow
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Plotting graphs with MatPlotLib
- Understanding how to work with Cloud Notebooks
- Data cleaning 
- Model training

#### With this project I also learned how to use Docker and make it available through an API in the Cloud, so it can be consumed by any app that it integrates with.
